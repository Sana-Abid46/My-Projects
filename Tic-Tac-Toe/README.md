* Project Description:

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is for players to alternately place "X" or "O" marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Key Features:

1) Responsive Design:

The game is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

2) User Interface:

The interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for players of all ages to understand and play the game.
Visual feedback is provided for each move, enhancing the user experience.

3) Game Logic:

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, ensuring smooth and efficient gameplay.
Functions are written to handle player turns, check for win conditions, and detect draws.

4) Reset Functionality:

Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round, providing endless entertainment.

5) Technical Details:

HTML: Used for structuring the game layout and elements.
CSS: Used for styling the game, including layout, colors, and animations to enhance visual appeal.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic, handling player interactions, and updating the game state.

* Learning Outcomes:
